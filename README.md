Low light street enhancement

Project abandoned. Refer to the notebooks for the model trainings.

The RetinexNet models are fully trained and model data included.\
The CycleGANs are abandoned midway in training due to higher training time and limited GPU time from Kaggle. 

The codes are fully functional and last tested on tensorflow 2.16.0 and keras 3.3.3.
